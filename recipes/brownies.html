        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Sugar: These easy brownies start with two cups of white sugar.</li>
            <li>Flour: All-purpose flour creates structure in the batter.</li>
            <li>Butter: Two sticks of melted butter give the brownies moisture and richness.</li>
            <li>Eggs: Eggs lend even more moisture. Plus, they help bind the batter together.</li>
            <li>Cocoa powder: Of course, you'll need cocoa powder for chocolate brownies!</li>
            <li>Vanilla: Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of the brownies.</li>
            <li>Baking powder: Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it helps the brownies rise.</li>
            <li>Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients.</li>
            <li>Walnuts: Nuts are optional, of course, but they add a welcome crunch.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch pan.</li>
            <li>Mix sugar, flour, melted butter, eggs, cocoa powder, vanilla, baking powder, 
                and salt in a large bowl until combined.

            <li>Decorate with walnut halves</li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven until top is dry and edges have started 
                to pull away from the sides of the pan, about 20 to 30 minutes.
            </li>
        </ol>
